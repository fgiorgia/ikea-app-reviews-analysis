## Dataset
I used a dataset collected from the Google Play Store for a project in the Introduction to Data Analytics Course 2023 for the [ReDI School of Digital Integration Malm√∂](https://www.redi-school.org/redi-school-malmo). Submitted by - Giorgia Faedda.

## Assignment instruction
Objective: To apply statistical techniques learned in class on real-world data, interpret results, and derive actionable insights.

### Data Collection
- **Goal**: Gather a dataset of your choice that contains at least 1000 observations.
- **Suggested Methods**:
  - Use online data repositories like Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository, or Google Dataset Search.
  - Conduct surveys or questionnaires related to a topic of interest.
  - Collect data from social media platforms, news websites, or e-commerce platforms (ensure you have the necessary permissions and adhere to terms of service).

### Data Cleaning & Preliminary Analysis:
**Tasks**:
- Handle missing data by imputation or deletion.
- Remove duplicates and outliers.
- Conduct a preliminary analysis: Calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation for the relevant columns in your dataset.

### Descriptive Statistics:
**Tasks**:
- Visualize the distribution of key variables using histograms or boxplots.
- Analyze the relationships between two or more variables using scatter plots and calculate Pearson's correlation coefficient.
- Identify and discuss any patterns or trends you observe in the data.

### Inferential Statistics:
**Tasks**:
- Formulate a hypothesis based on your data. For example, if you've collected data on student study hours and exam scores, your hypothesis might be "Students who study more than 5 hours a day score above 85% on average."
- Perform a t-test or ANOVA to test your hypothesis, depending on the nature of your data.
- Calculate a 95% confidence interval for a key metric in your data.
- Discuss the results: Was your hypothesis supported? What conclusions can you draw?

### Advanced Analysis (Optional):
**Tasks**:
- If your data is time-series data, conduct a time-series analysis to predict future values.
- If you've multiple variables, consider dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- Apply regression analysis if suitable for your data.

### Conclusion & Recommendations:
**Tasks**:
- Summarize your findings.
- Based on your analysis, provide recommendations. For instance, if you analyzed data from a company's sales, what strategies might increase those sales?

### Presentation:
Prepare a presentation of your findings. Ensure it's structured with an introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. Use visual aids like graphs and charts to illustrate your points.

### Evaluation Criteria:
- Quality and relevance of the dataset chosen.
- Accuracy in applying statistical techniques.
- Depth of analysis and insights derived.
- Presentation clarity and structure.
- Justification for conclusions and recommendations.
